1. Practice JSX syntax by yourself

2. Design a basic counter that includes a field for displaying the current count and two buttons: one for increasing the count by 1 and the other for decreasing it by 1. When the "Increase by 1" button is pressed, the counter should increment by 1, and the "Decrease" button should decrease it by 1 in a similar manner.
